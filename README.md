# COMP 370 Homework 9

This is a project to practice implementing a tf-idf algorithm on a dataset.

This repo contains 2 scripts:
`./scripts/compute_pony_lang.py` and `./scripts/compile_word_counts.py`

One to compute the tf-idf scores of each word in a document, and the other to compile the word counts for each pony.


## TODO

- Testing

# Setup/Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Running

`python -m scripts.compile_word_counts -h` for usage of the  `compile_word_counts` script.

`python -m scripts.compute_pony_lang -h` for usage of the `compute_pony_lang` script.
